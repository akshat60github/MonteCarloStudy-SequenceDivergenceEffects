# MonteCarloStudy-SequenceDivergenceEffects
 designed and ran a simulation study to investigate how increasing sequence divergence affects: 1. distance measures (Hamming and edit distance) global vs local alignment (needleman–wunsch and Smith–waterman) motif recovery using a simple position weight matrix (PWM) approach
