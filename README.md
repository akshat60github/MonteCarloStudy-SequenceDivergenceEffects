# Monte Carlo Study of Sequence Divergence Effects on Alignment and Motif Recovery
 designed and ran a simulation study to investigate how increasing sequence divergence affects: 
 1. distance measures (Hamming and edit distance) 
 2. global vs local alignment (needleman–wunsch and Smith–waterman) 
 3. motif recovery using a simple position weight matrix (PWM) approach
